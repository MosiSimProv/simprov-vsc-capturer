VSCode Plugin
=============

An exemplary SimPROV provenance capturer for VSCode.

The complete quickstart guide for SimProv can be found under https://simprov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/quickstart.html.


.. note::

    This plugin is just a proof of concept, i.e., it is designed to exactly work the rules and patterns used by our case studies.
	The rules and patterns can also be found under https://github.com/MosiSimProv/simprov-quickstart/tree/main/examples . 


Features
--------
- Capturing provnenance information from Visual Studio Code
- Custom commands for creating new assumptions, requirements, simulation models, and experiments

Conventions
-----------

This capturer mainly relies on the following file conventions:

    - Research Question: ``research question.md`` (Markdown)
    - Assumption : ``assumption(.|\s)*\.md`` (Markdown)
    - Reference : ``reference(.|\s)*\.md`` (Markdown)
    - Requirement: ``requirement(.|\s)*\.md`` (Markdown)
    - Simulation Model: ``model(.|\s)*\.mlr`` (ML-Rules)
    - Experiment: ``experiment(.|\s)*\.py`` (Python)


Commands
--------

- ``New Simulation Study`` - Creates a new simulation study; Allows you to create and select a directory. Will create a ``.study`` file storing internal information. Also it will also load all files from https://github.com/MosiSimprov/simprov-quickstart to get your started.
- ``New Research Question`` - Will create a new file for specifying the research question of the study. Also allows to select references based on which the research question was derived.
- ``New Assumption`` - Will create a new file for specifying an assumption. Also allows to select references based on which the assumption was derived.
- ``New Requirement`` - Will create a new file for specifying a requirement. Also allows to select references based on which the requirement was derived.
- ``New Simulation Model`` - Will create a new file for a simulation model. Also allows to select requirements and assumptions to make their relation explicit.
- ``New Simulation Experiment`` - Will create a new file for a simulation experiment. Also allows to select a simulation model, requirements and assumptions to make their relation explicit.
- ``New Reference`` - Will create a new file for a reference.

Dependencies
------------

* `Visual Studio Code`_ the new fancy editor everyone seems to love (Version Tested: 1.86.2).
